// Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh and Howard are in the queue for a "Double Cola" 
// drink vending machine; there are no other people in the queue. The first one in the queue (
// Sheldon) buys a can, drinks it and doubles! The resulting two Sheldons go to the end of the queue. 
// Then the next in the queue (Leonard) buys a can, drinks it and gets to the end of the queue as two Leonards, 
// and so on.
// For example, 
// Penny drinks the third can of cola and the queue will 
// look like this:
// Rajesh, Howard, Sheldon, Sheldon, Leonard, Leonard, 
// Penny, Penny
// Write a program that will return the name of the person who will drink the n-th cola.
// Input
// The input data consist of an array which contains at least 1 name,
//  and single integer n which may go as high as the biggest number your
//  language of choice supports (if there's such limit, of course).

// Output / Examples
// Return the single line â€” the name of the person who drinks the n-th can of cola. The cans are numbered starting from 1.
